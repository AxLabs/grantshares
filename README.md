# GrantShares Program üí∞

The GrantShares Program is a discretionary grants program governed by the GrantSharesDAO, where
funds would be primarily provided by the Neo Foundation and partner initiatives.

GrantSharesDAO is composed of GrantShares 'Council Members' (or, in short, "GrantSharesDAO Members"),
which are initially appointed by the Neo Foundation. The GrantSharesDAO Members are a small group
of individuals/entities aiming to increase Neo's impact and reach through community activities.

The DAO Members analyze project proposals submitted to the GrantSharesDAO, with the goal to benefit
the growth and development of the Neo ecosystem. Each DAO Member may vote to approve or reject a proposal.
